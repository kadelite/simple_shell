# Simple Shell

## Introduction
This repository is a `Holberton School Project`. 
The school project consisted in writing a shell like sh (Bourne Shell) by Stephen Bourne , in C, using a limited number of standard library functions,
So Instead we used ower own function that we rewrited over the past three month Here

The goal in this project was to make us understand how a shell works. To single out some items: what is the environment, the difference between functions and system calls, how to create processes using execve...

## Usage
In order to run this program,
1. Clone This `Repo`

2. git clone `https://github.com/Theemiss/simple_shell`

3. compile it with `gcc` 4.8.4 `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic` *.c -o hsh.

4. You can then run it by invoking ./hsh in that same directory.

## How to use it

* In order to use this shell, in a terminal, first run the program:
prompt$ ./hsh
* It wil then display a simple prompt and wait for commands.
`$`
* A command will be of the type $ command
* This shell can handle two types of commands: builtins and normal program.

## List of built-ins

Currently the list of built-ins I wrote is:

```C
cd [directory]
Switch to the specified directory (path).

env
Displays the environment variable

exit [exitstatus]
Exit from the program with exitstatus value. 0 by default.

getenv NAME
Return the value of the NAME variable if it is in the environment

help [command]
Displays the syntax for the command, or all commands.

history
Displays the last typed user .

echo [$$] or [$?] or [$PATH] Return pid and exit statue and PATH.
```

## Command
Basicly Every Program in $PATH It Support Single Word like ls

It Handle Path ls /tmp

it Handle Options Like ls -l

it Handle All Three Togther Like ls -l /var

it Handle Command Path Also Like /bin/ls And All The Option And Path Like /bin/ls -l /var

it Handle Comments #


Also
Handle Ctrl+C: your shell should not quit when the user inputs ^C
If no argument is given to cd the command must be interpreted like cd $HOME
handle the command cd -
Handle variables replacement
Handle the $? variable
Handle the $$ variable
Handle The Argument file like ./hsh test Where test is a file filled with command and builtin to excute.
